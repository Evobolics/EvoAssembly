Structural is really referential and needs to be renamed as such; as with this model, you are allowed to keep assemblies siloed and referencing each other.  Semantic model resolves the 
references.  Bound, has runtime linkage.  emitted has emitted types.  Converted, has emitted types that are converted from referential and semantic types.
