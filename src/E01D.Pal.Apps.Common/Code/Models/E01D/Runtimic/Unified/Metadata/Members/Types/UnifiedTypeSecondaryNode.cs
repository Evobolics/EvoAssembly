	/// Represents a "runtime instance type" / "type specification".  The names definition and specification are very confusing as they are 
	/// quite synomous.  A definition means "a statement of the exact meaning of a word, especially in a dictionary."  A specification means
	/// "an act of describing or identifying something precisely; stating a precise requirement; a detailed description." The words precisely and detailed imply
	/// the concept of 'definition' which is supposed to precisely and detailed.  Thus new words were found to better describe the relationship.  Currently
	/// thosew words are primary and secondary.
